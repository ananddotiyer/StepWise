# StepWise

StepWise is a Windows based test automation tool.  What makes it different from other standard tools (including QTP) is that it helps in partially automating test scenarios.  Some examples for scenarios that need partial automation are synchronizing the test execution, verification procedures that often need expensive investment to create a fool-proof automation around it, handling of exceptions and so on.  In all the above mentioned cases, manual intervention is desirable.  In the proposed scheme of partial automation, there should be a mechanism that seamlessly switches between the manual and automated execution.

Core features of the tool include

- Recording of user actions, which creates readable code.
- Agnostic to screen resolution, window size and/or location
- Built-in debugger.
- Supports AutoIT syntax.
- Supports framework creation, including parameterization using data-driven techniques.
- Ready-to-run browser compatibility tests.
- Allows note-taking during exploratory sessions.
